make nav bar stationary when scrolling + smaller in size

add commas in population elements

create drop down to sort films (and planets and characters if possible) by different orders

add more fun interaction

create new page showing details of ships. Will have to research how to render new pages.

create search function for ships (and characters if time)

create a next button for the ships page (as it only renders 36 ships)

sort characters alphabetically
